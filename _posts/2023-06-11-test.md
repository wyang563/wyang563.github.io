Hello world! My name is William Yang and I'm currently a junior at MIT studying computer science, math, and writing, though my present interests span a wide range of concepts further than just those subjects. My research work mainly centers around data analytics and machine learning, where I have worked on projects ranging from satellite remote sensing learning to natural language question answering tasks. 

Aside from academics, I dabble in writing, urban exploration, piano, and rock climbing. I've written a couple of short stories, memoirs, and other miscellaneous pieces that I've migrated over from my old medium blog to here.
