7/21/21:

The purpose of this post is not to convince any one to live their life a certain way, but rather to espouse some of my opinions on what guiding principles should dictate major life decisions one makes. Of these principles, perhaps the most important one can be summed up simply as ‘this is your life’. There are two meanings behind this otherwise short phrase — first is that generally I am indifferent towards how others decide their life goals. After all, ‘this is your life’ and who am I to judge how you should formulate your own future. Second is that no one but you should dictate major life choices and goals you hold. When I repeat ‘this is your life’ to myself, I’m reminded that no controlling figure in my life, whether it be a parent, friend, or other adult should have too overbearing of an opinion on what I believe to be good life principles to live by.

So ‘this is my life’ right? Supposedly, if this is my guiding life principle, I would have self confidence to plot out my own goals. I’d know what makes me happy, what work is meaningful to me. I should have an organized schedule optimized to pursue activities I and only myself find beneficial to my future and present well being. For people my age, there’s almost an unspoken pressure from society to have a concrete vision of what your path in life should be. Will you be a software engineer? A banker perhaps, or how about a doctor? What about a writer, or a musician, something considered “off the rails” by most Asian parents. Whatever your interest, at the bare minimum, you must know it and have some semblance of a path in mind.

Yet, I’ll be the first to admit that I feel my life has little defined direction now, and quite frankly that out of everyone I know, I’m probably the worst at making decisive life choices that are beneficial for my future self. What do you want to do after college? What career or passion do you want to pursue? These are questions I tend to bury in the deepest trenches of my conscious, hoping to indefinitely delay. Complacency in the status quo, in other words, has somewhat become my motto. In college, especially a difficult one like MIT, it’s really easy to just bury yourself in coursework and blindly grind problem sets twenty four seven without really doing any big picture thinking. It’s easy to get lost in the crowd of math and CS people who dominate your dorm and forget there are a great multitude of other diverse paths one can take in life.

“This is your life.”

I can choose what I do.

I am free.

I can decide my future.

I should do only what I enjoy! I should journal more along the Charles on summer evenings, practice more piano pieces I love listening to now for hours on end, or just build fantastical worlds filled with sorcerers and warlocks in my mind alone in my room while staring at the ceiling.

I am free?

Then why am I a masochist? I willingly follow my friends to overload on painstaking CS courses and take dreadful math classes all in the name of making myself “marketable”. I toil away at night on problem sets and programming projects, all while yearning to do the activities I truly enjoy.

And so in the midst of the whirlwind of homework, clubs, fruitless efforts to get internships, my once nimble fingers forgot the notes of the Debussy‘s’ Arabesque. The small notebook where I journaled daily over the summer was left untouched for weeks on end. Yet the short moments when I did write alone at midnight in a silent building 10 or read Ted Chiang’s science fiction till 4am, I found myself the most calm despite the onslaught of work to come the following days.

I am unwise. I know nothing of how to plan a career or long term life path that satisfies what I define as fulfilling, and I accept that as my weakness. Shifting from the status quo is daunting, but for now I know deviating from my current path to instead invest in the activities that make me happiest will bring me joy, even if it’s in the oh so slightest of ways.

“This is my life”. I choose what I do, not the selection of classes and activities my friends make.

“This is my life”. I choose what I do, not the salary promised by certain careers.

“This is my life. Your life should be yours too”.
