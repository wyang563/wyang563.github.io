## A Prelude -

A salty mist sprays over the wet wooden deck as the ship sways back and forth violently, toyed with by the howling winds as if it were just a small top. I attempt to steer the oversized wooden wheel in the figment of my imagination in a desperate attempt to save ship, but the cabin lurches left as a rogue wave collides with the vessel. Large wooden chests and barrels of cargo come tumbling down towards me, and all I feel is the noisy thud of my ribs breaking as my falling skull smashes into the floor.

Head spinning after my fall, I feebly raise myself from the ground with shaking arms. I’m now in a clean gym, punching bag hanging from the ceiling in front of me as a cacophony of adults I cannot see yell at me. I can’t discern what they’re saying, nor do I try, as I strain my blurred vision to focus on the bag in front of me. One more round, one more round, one more punch at it… My arm extends but my mind wants to pull back as my fist approaches the bag; a slight flicker in my subconscious says something is wrong, but it’s too late. My fist crumples as it hits what now is a concrete wall that abruptly replaced the punching bag. I let out a scream of indifferent pain.

I nervously pull my fist back from the concrete wall, glaring with frustration at the locked metal door keeping me back. A silver metal Schlage Primus padlock hooked onto the door latch taunts me from afar, so perfect in its craft of keeping people out of reach from places they shouldn’t be. A mistake has already been made. The loud sound from my punch has alerted the custodians of my presence; their footsteps are already echoing along the stairwell as they rush up. Time is up, slowly siphoning out of the graduated hourglass as the minutes passed turn into hours. I’m still there, atop the stairwell after all that time, but now sinking into the floor into an inky dark void below.

## Universes -

Before we discuss the story and its constituent parts: the setting, the conflict, the plot, the characters, we first need to acknowledge the universe they operate in. Of which, there are two. The “universe” is what I can observe and how I understand reality. It is a rather foggy horizon that’s more limiting than I’d prefer. The “universe” provides enough information for me to survive. It contains the knowledge that I should get a well paying job to be content, but not the underlying reason why money would lead to happiness. It tells me that making as large a number of friends is good, but not how to forge meaningful in depth relationships that will stand the test of time. The “universe” is all the scientific theories I know and the life lessons I’ve painfully learned, but lacks everything I find essential to the heart.

The “Universe” is reality as it actually is. It includes the theory of everything that physicists hope to find; it includes an answer to what the meaning of life is that philosophers have sought to answer for millenia. Yet, there’s something alienating about the “Universe”. A quest rooted in the desire to know everything inexorably leads to disappointment following a regressive chain of questions surfacing from each answer one attains. Obsession is often born from such goals driving the brightest minds to madness while average minds are left lazily complacent, unwilling to consider scaling such gargantuan intellectual challenges.

This is the story of my universe. From the flashing supernovas pouring white light to warm the cold unforgiving cosmos, to the momentary glimpses of the skyline I attempt grasping on rooftops. It stretches from colliding galaxies lighting the sky ablaze with the birth of new stars to the slow walk I make on a leaf covered sidewalk to admit to cheating. It tugs at me as strongly as the largest black holes and yet leaves me lonely looking at the chilly riverside while the sun rises in the orange sky.

Part one is nebulas.
