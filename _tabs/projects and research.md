## MIT Camera Culture Group

I am currently working on improving the accuracy of a shadow based Neural Radiance Field model by using a GAN architecture to accurately map sunlight angles to image colors. I'm using Blender to generate synthetic satellite image data to supplement existing training data for satellite NeRF models. I implemeneted the GAN using a U-net generator to synthesize building outline maps of given satellite images to aid in the 3D modelling process. 

## C++ Poker-Bot

<https://github.com/21chenb/pokerbot-2023>

I built a C++ poker bot to play a variant of Texas Hold’Em for the MIT PokerBots competition implementing various poker strategies. My team's bot ended up placing 2nd among C++ pokerbots in the final tournament. 

## Vector College Planning Website

<https://github.com/wyang563/Vector>

I worked with a hackathon team in full stack development of a ReactJS based website that helps users plan college applications. The site was built with a MongoDB backend schema system to sture user information and run various APIs. 

## Musical Automata

<https://github.com/wyang563/musicalAutomata>

Ongoing project. So far I've implemented a simple website using a canvas-based UI to generate music based on an evolving board state of Conway’s
Game of Life.

## Policy Debate Database

<https://github.com/wyang563/policyDebateDatabase>

I implement a variety of programs to scrape various data points from policy debate results websites via the use of selenium and a spider crawling algorithm. The data included debater speaker points, pref rates of judges, the rate at which specific judges sat on 3 judge panels, and the average speaks that individual judges gave. The data was all compiled using gsSpread and Pandas.
