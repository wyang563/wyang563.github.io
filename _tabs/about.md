Hello world! My name is William Yang and I'm currently a junior at MIT studying computer science, math, and writing, though my present interests span a wide range of concepts further than just those subjects. My research work mainly centers around data analytics and machine learning, where I have worked on projects ranging from satellite remote sensing learning to natural language question answering tasks. Please check out past projects and research I've done on my GitHub or under the projects tab on the side bar. 

Aside from academics, I dabble in writing, urban exploration, piano, and rock climbing. I've written a couple of short stories, memoirs, and other miscellaneous pieces that I've migrated over from my old medium blog to here.
